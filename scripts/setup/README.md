# BLT Network Setup Script

Setup script for decentralized launches of BLT networks.

## setup-validator

run this if you're trying to join an existing network and just need to provision the validator node. Once provisioned, you'll need to request/get BLT tokens in order to stake as a validator

## prepare-genesis

run this if you're trying to launch a new network. This will generate the genesis file and the gentx file. You will need to distribute the genesis file to all the other nodes and the gentx file to the validator node.

## setup-price-feeder

run this if you're trying to setup a price feeder service on a validator node post genesis. Then you'll need to transfer she tokens to the feeder address wallet in order for oracle to work properly
